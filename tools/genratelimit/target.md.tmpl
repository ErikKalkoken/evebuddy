## Rate limit groups

This section shows the current configuration of all active rate limit groups.

Group | Max tokens | Windows size | Average rate
-- | -- | -- | --
{{- range $key, $group := .Groups}}
{{$group.Name}} | {{$group.MaxTokens}} | {{$group.WindowSize}} | {{$group.AverageRate}}
{{- end }}

The windows size is given in seconds. The average rate is given in requests per second.

## Operations by tag

The operations are structured by tags.

{{- range $key1, $value1 := .Tags }}

### {{ $key1 }}

Operation ID | Rate limit Group
-- | --
{{- range $key2, $value2 := $value1 }}
{{ $key2 }} | {{if $value2}}{{$value2}}{{else}}-{{end}}
{{- end }}
{{- end }}

## Operations flat
